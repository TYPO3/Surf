# Surf

Surf package is an automated deployment tool. It is best used but by far not limited to deploy TYPO3 CMS and Flow applications.
It's inspired by some features of Capistrano concerning the Git workflow.

Some features of the Surf package:

* Remote checkout of Git repositories with submodules
* Flexible, declarative configuration of deployments
* Multi-node (Cloud), multi-application (i.e. separated frontend and backend) deployments
* Create custom tasks with a few lines
* Simulate deployments with a dry run
* Pre-defined workflows for TYPO3, Flow, Neos and Laravel deployments
