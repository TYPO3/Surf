# Surf

This package is a powerful and flexible automated deployment tool for PHP projects. It is best suited for, but by no
means limited to, deploying [TYPO3](https://typo3.org), [Flow](https://flow.neos.io/) and [Neos](https://www.neos.io)
applications. It is inspired by some features of Capistrano (thank you) in terms of the Git workflow.
