Introduction

Surf package is a complete automated deployment tool. It is best used but by far not limited to deploy TYPO3 CMS and Flow applications. It's inspired by some features of Capistrano (thanks) concerning the Git workflow.

Some of the features of the Surf package:

* Remote checkout of Git repositories with submodules (sorry, no SVN yet)
* Flexible, declarative configuration of deployments
* Multi-node, multi-application, multi-deployment deployments
* Hook in any deployment stage
* Create custom tasks with a few lines
* Simulate deployments with a dry run
