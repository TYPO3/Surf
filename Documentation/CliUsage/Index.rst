List available deployments
--------------------------

You can get a list of available deployments by running::

    $ surf show

Test a deployment
-----------------

You can get a description of the deployment by running::

    $ surf describe MyDeployment

Simulate the deployment by running::

    $ surf simulate MyDeployment

The simulation gives a hint which tasks will be executed on which node. During simulation no harmful tasks will be
executed for real. If a remote SSH command would be executed it will be printed in the log messages starting with
``... $nodeName: "command"``.

Run a deployment
----------------

If everything looks right, you can run the deployment::

    $ surf deploy MyDeployment

.. _cli-usage-configuration-path-section:

Rollback deployment
-------------------

If your release does not meet your demand, you can quickly rollback to the previous one::

   $ surf rollback MyDeployment

Using a different configuration path
------------------------------------

If you want to use a different configuration path than `.surf` use the provided option like this::

    $ surf show --configurationPath myConfigurationPath
