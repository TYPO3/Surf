.. php:class:: CleanupReleasesTask

    A cleanup task to delete old (unused) releases.

    Cleanup old releases by listing all releases and keeping a configurable number of old releases (application option "keepReleases"). The current and previous release (if one exists) are protected from removal.

    Note: There is no rollback for this cleanup, so we have to be sure not to delete any live or referenced releases.

    It takes the following options:

    * keepReleases - The number of releases to keep.

    Example configuration:
        $application->setOption('keepReleases', 2);
    Note: There is no rollback for this cleanup, so we have to be sure not to delete any live or referenced releases.
