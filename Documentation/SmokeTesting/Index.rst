=============
Smoke Testing
=============

As you do automated deployments, you should check if the website is up and running
before switching it to the live site. This is called a *Smoke Test*. We will give
an example for using the built-in HTTP smoke test.

First, you need to create a virtual host with document root in "<deploymentDirectory>/releases/next/Web".
While a deployment is running, the new website will be available under this URL and can
be used for testing.

Then, add a test as follows to the deployment configuration::

	<?php

	$workflow = new \TYPO3\Surf\Domain\Model\SimpleWorkflow();

	$smokeTestOptions = [
		'url' => 'http://your-website.com',
		'remote' => true,
		'expectedStatus' => 200,
		'expectedRegexp' => '/somethingYouExpectOnThePage/'
	];
	$workflow->defineTask('MyCompany\\MyPackage\\SmokeTest', \TYPO3\Surf\Task\Test\HttpTestTask::class, $smokeTestOptions);

	$workflow->addTask('MyCompany\\MyPackage\\SmokeTest', 'test', $application);

The HTTP test has the following options:

Most important options:

* url (required): URL which should be loaded
* remote: if TRUE, the smoke test is triggered through the SSH channel on the remote host
  via command-line CURL. If false, it is triggered from the deploying host.
* expectedStatus: expected HTTP status code
* expectedHeaders: HTTP Header Strings which are expected (can be a multiline string,
  each header being on a separate line)
* expectedRegexp: Regular Expression to test the contents of the HTTP response against

Further options:

* timeout (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP timeout to use
* port (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP Port to use
* method (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP method to use (default GET)
* username (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP Authentication username
* password (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP Authentication Password
* data (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP payload
* proxy (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP Proxy to use
* proxyPort  (only if remote=FALSE): HTTP Proxy port to use
* additionalCurlParameters (only if remote=TRUE): list of parameters which
  is directly passed to CURL. Especially useful to e.g. disable SSL certificate
  check (with --insecure)

Tests in test stage and caches
------------------------------

In the test stage, the caches of the application is not flushed in order not to affect the live page.
A possible solution is to disable caches when running smoke tests in the test stage on "next" release.

TYPO3
^^^^^

AdditionalConfiguration.php::

	if ($context->isTesting()){
		foreach ($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['caching']['cacheConfigurations'] as $cacheName => $cacheConfiguration) {
			$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['caching']['cacheConfigurations'][$cacheName]['backend'] = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Cache\Backend\NullBackend::class;
		}
	}

.htaccess::

	# Add Rewrite rule near https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/main/typo3/sysext/install/Resources/Private/FolderStructureTemplateFiles/root-htaccess#L270
	RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^next\.example\.com$
	RewriteRule .? - [E=TYPO3_CONTEXT:Testing]


If you are not able to set environment variables via .htaccess, you can use composer autoloading and a PHP file.
Thanks to the team of jweiland.net for this solution.

Root composer.json::

	{
		"autoload": {
			"files": ["scripts/typo3context.php"]
		}
	}

typo3context.php::

	<?php
	// Set the application context in this file because it is not possible to set environment variables
	// via .htaccess e.g. on domainFACTORY/jweiland.net servers
	$context = 'Production';

	// detect application context by domain
	if (array_key_exists('HTTP_HOST', $_SERVER)) {
		if (0 === strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 'next.')) {
			$context = 'Testing';
		}
	}
	putenv('TYPO3_CONTEXT=' . $context);
